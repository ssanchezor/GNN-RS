# AIDL21: Recommender Systems with GCN

This repository contains different machine learning models, such as FM, GCN and GAT, that are commonly used to implement personalized Recommender Systems. It consists of a first part to explain, in a theoretical manner, the main characteristics of this type of systems, as well as a second part with a set of detailed steps on how to run the program.

Our project aims to compare the different models and evaluate how well they perform in making recommendations. In order to do this, for each of them we will measure some metrics (HR, NDCG, Coverage, etc...) that are frequently used in this area.

Finally, we will perform a detailed analysis of the obtained results in order to detect and assess possible biases.

## 1. Introduction <a name="1-intro"></a>

Nowadays Recommender Systems have become a key peace to solve the problem of overload information. The information if far for being reduced, as well as the diversity of users that uses platform such as  Netflix, wirh more than 17.000 titles and 221.64 million of paying subscriptions, or Amazon, with116.44 billion U.S. dollars sales and more than 200 million Prime members.

But what makes a recommender a good recommender? It is not only a question of personalizing the recommendations in such a way that the system shows the user items related to their tastes, but also of reflecting the diversity in a fair way, so that users can discover new things that may interest them and, at the same time, the systems ensure that no bias or, worse, discrimination is added.

Of course, some items are popular for a reason, so it is important to find a trade-off between accuracy & fairness.


### 1.1. Motivation <a name="11-motivation"></a>

In this project we have compared differents methods and models to make  recommendations and we have tried to find out which of them gives  more balanced results in terms of hits and fairness, reducing the popularity bias without damaging the quality of the ranking.


### 1.2. Objectives <a name="12-milestones"></a>

The main purpose of this project is to test the potencial of deep neural networks to solve the problem of personalize recommendations, in particular the use of Graph convolutional networks and Graph attention networks and to analyze how to popularity bias affect  each model.  To be more specific, the main objectives are the following:
- Find a complete dataset that fits the task. In this case we opted for an H&M dataset.
- Explore and undestand the data, clean and pre-process it to be used for training and test our models.
- Implement different simple models as Random and Popularity to have a reference.
- Implement a Factorization Machine with regular embeddings and after add embeddings generated by an GCN and GAT and analyze the results.
- Explore the Popularity Bias and analyze how it affects each model.
- Carried out some experiments adding more data expecting improvements in the results.
- Add some features related to the contexto of the transaction a evaluate how each model results is affected.
- Extract conclusions and insights from the results and visualize them in an understandable way.

## 2. Corpora <a name="2-available-datasets"></a>

For training and testing our models, we have used the dataset provided by the healthcare organization for informatics in medical imaging, the [Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine (SIIM)](https://siim.org/) joined by the [International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)](https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/wideContentTop/main). 

After some filtering for rebalancing the missing or non-labeled images and cutting off the excess of benign lesions, we finish with a total number of 22,922 images split in Train (16,045 observations) and Test (6,877 observations).

### 2.1. Data Description  <a name="21-eda"></a>

Through the API available in the ISIC home page we have been able to download all the images collection with its descriptions associated. The whole database is about 110 gigabytes (GB). The format of the colour images is both JPEG and PNG with a high variety of resolution sizes. Each image has a corresponding JSON-based description file with the image metadata information. From these metadata files we have been conducted a quick Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to acquire more awareness of how distributed it is. Initially, there were 27 metadata fields from which we later filtered out and kept only 8 of them. Some meaningful classes worthy to mention are the dcm_name field which identifies the image associated; the benign_malignant class from which we later classify; and finally the diagnosis class which details the diagnosis of the dermatological image lesion is referred to.

<p align="center">
  <img width="90%" height="90%" src="Data/images-sagan/diagnosis.png"/>
</p>


As we mention, we carried out a gently Data Wrangling to obtain some useful insight about the images data handling. From this procedure we have verified that there is a very high target class imbalance which need to take in consideration when modeling.

### 2.2. Pre-processing  <a name="22-preprocessing"></a> 

To be able to feed our dataset into the classifier, we must first condition it to the network and to our resource’s limitations.

#### CSV files

As mentioned before, every image comes with a JSON files with relevant information regarding the patient and the skin spot. This files were all put into a CSV file where each column stands for a field from the JSON file. 
In addition to the initial fields, we added “dcm_name” to store the name of the image the data belongs to, and “target” which is set to 0 if the skin spot is benign and to 1 in case it is malignant.

#### Dataset reduction

We reduced the dataset to 5K images to diminish the training cost, keeping the malignant/benign ratio so the results can be escalated to the complete dataset.

Given the size of the image’s directory, we modified it so it only contained the images that were going to be fed into the network, in order not to use more storage than necessary in GCP. We did this through a series of automated functions in python.

#### Data augmentation

We applied several transformations to avoid overfitting when training our network with the reduced dataset. To do that, we have used albumentations’ library due to the large number of augmentations it has available.

The images input size was variable and with a bigger resolution, we resized them to 128x128 to fit the synthetically generated images. Furthermore, we applied techniques involving changing the image’s contrast and brightness scale and rotations. We also normalized its mean and standard deviation and finally we converted the images ton tensors so they can be feed into our model.

Here are some of the images before and after applying the transformations.

## 3. Deep Neural Networks Models <a name="3-dnns"></a>

Under this section we present all the GAN versions implemented. We approach to the proble with our own variation of implementation of the technique and methodology first introduced in [Frid-Adar et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01229) in 2018.

### 3.1. Evaluation Metrics  <a name="31-metrics"></a>

Since we lack from any medical expertise for assessing the quality of the generated images, we have implemented several metrics to measure traits of our output pictures.

- #### Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)

This metric is used to measure the quality of a given image (noise), which underwent some transformation, compared to the its original (signal). In our case, the original picture is the real batch of images feeded into our network and the noise is represented by a given generated image.

- #### Structural Similarity (SSIM)

SSIM aims to predict the perceived the quality of a digital image. It is a perception based model that computes the degradation in an image comparison as in the preceived change in the structural information. This metric captures the perceptual changes in traits such as luminance and contrast.

- #### Multi-Scale Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation (MS GMSD)

MS-GMSD works on a similar version as SSIM, but it also accounts for different scales for computing luminance and incorporates chromatic distortion support.

- #### Mean Deviation Similarity Index (MDSI)

MDSI computes the joint similarity map of two chromatic channels through standard deviation pooling, which serves as an estimate of color changes. 

- #### Haar Perceptural Similarity Index (HaarPSI)

HaarPSI works on the Haar wavelet decomposition and assesses local similarities between two images and the relative importance of those local regions. This metric is the current state-of-the-art as for the agreement with human opinion on image quality. 

- #### Measure Assessment

Measure | Bar | 
:------: | :------:|
PSNR   | Context dependant, generally the higher the better.  | 
SSIM   |  Ranges from 0 to 1, being 1 the best value.     | 
MS-GMSD |  Ranges from 0 to 1, being 1 the best value.    |  
MDSI   |   Ranges from 0 to inf, being 0 the best value.    |
HaarPSI |   Ranges from 0 to 1, being 1 the best value.   |

### 3.2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  <a name="32-gans"></a>

- [DC-GAN](DC-SN-GAN)<a name="DC-GAN"></a>

A DC-GAN is a specific flavor of GAN dedicated to image generation. The architecture consists on a _Generator_ and a _Discriminator_ built upon four 2d convolutional layers. It was first described by _Radford et. al._ in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf). The _Discriminator_ in build out of strided convolutions, batch normalization layers and uses Leaky Relu activations. Originally, the input size of the images is 64 and it is already set to process color images (3x64x64). The _Generator_ differs from the _Discriminator_ in the convolutional layers, which are transposed. It has as an input a random vector sampled from a normal distribution which will be transformed by adversarial training into an RGB image of the selected shape.

- [W-GAN](W-GAN)<a name="W-GAN"></a>

The Wasserstein GAN (W-GAN) is a variant to the traditional implementation of the generative adversarial networks for improving the training phase. The adversarial loss aims at finding the Nash equilibrium, which in practice is difficult to achieve and it may result in model oscillation and mode collapse. The idea behind the W-GAN is to stabilize the model training by focusing on minimizing an approximation of the Earth-Mover's distance (EM) rather than the Jensen-Shannon divergence as in the original GAN formulation. Moreover, the discriminator is changed by a critic that scores the realness or fakeness of a given image. 
By doing so, the loss of the discriminator seems to relate with the quality of the images generated by the model. 


- [AC-GAN](AC-GAN)<a name="AC-GAN"></a>

Conditional  GANs  are  an  extension  of  the  GAN model,  that  enable  the  model  to  be  conditioned  on  external information to improve the quality of the generated samples. It changes the discriminator to predict the class label of a given image rather than receive it as input. It has the effect of stabilizing the training process and allowing the generation of large high-quality images whilst learning a representation in the latent space that is independent of the class label.

- [SN-GAN](DC-SN-GAN)<a name="SN-GAN"></a>

The SN-GAN is identical to DC-GAN but implements _Spectral Normalization_ to deal with the issue of exploding gradients in the _Discriminator_. 

Spectral normalization is a weight regularization technique with is applied to the GAN's _Discriminator_ to solve the issue of exploding gradients. Is works stabilizing the training process of the _Discriminator_ through a rescaling the weights of the convolution layers using a norm (spectral norm) which is calculated using the power iteration method. The method is triggered right before the _forward()_ function call.

In more detail, spectral normalization deals with Lipschitz constant as its only hyper-paramenter. This constant refers to a regularization property of continuous functions which bounds its values. More precisely, the Lipschitz constant equals the maximum value of the derivatives of the function. In out particular case, since the activation function is a LeakyRelu, this constant takes the value 1. 

Spectral normalization controls this parameter in the discriminator by bounding it through the spectral norm. The Lipschitz norm ![g_lip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48655676/115139673-7f08ee00-a033-11eb-9495-79dfe24bbc0c.gif) is equivalent to the superior bound of the gradient of the layer ![sup_g](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48655676/115155321-b0a7a680-a07f-11eb-9997-861feab751e9.gif), where ![sigma_a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48655676/115139724-c0010280-a033-11eb-9030-70b1c31bee33.gif) is defined as the spectral norm of the matrix A. That gives,

![big_eq](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48655676/115139854-a7451c80-a034-11eb-8be2-53549d5fa4af.gif),

which is the largest singuler value of A and **h** is the linear layer.

With the above definition of a linear layer, when passing weights through as ![pass_W](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48655676/115139979-49650480-a035-11eb-8527-394564873320.gif), the norm of the layer is defined as,

![big_all_eq](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48655676/115140094-d740ef80-a035-11eb-8944-7074fec8c592.gif).

Therefore, spectral normalization of a given passing weight **W** normalizes the weight of each layer and thus, the whole network, mitigaiting explosion gradient problems.

Some works refer to DCGANs that implement spectral normalization as SNGANs, which is also done in this work. SNGAN with the best parameters and implementations described in the respective folder was the one used for the image generation.

### 3.2. EfficientNet 

EfficientNet is a convolutional neuronal network that provides and optimal relation between the number of parameters of a network and its efficiency. It accomplishes this using a mobile size baseline architecture, EfficientNet-b0, and performing a compound scaling to increase its size by replicating the baseline to different MBConv blocks. This network was firstly presented by Google in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946). Up to this day, EfficientNet has been scaled from its baseline that contains 5.3M parameters to b7, with 66M parameters.

We selected PyTorch as framwork for our scientific computing package to develop our project. Regarding the image transformations used for standard augmentations, we have selected both Torchvision and Albumentation packages. To approach the imbalance dataset issue we used Torchsampler’s Imbalanced Dataset Sampler library. For visualization, we also used both classical Pyplot and Seaborn packages. For the dataset preprocessing, we made use of the modules available in Scikit-Learn library. Some of the GANs-based implementations developed make use of YAML as the preferred language for defining its configuration parameters files. Lastly, the package Pytorch Image Quality Assessment (PIQA) is used to generate the metrics that evaluate the quality of the synthetic images. And finally, for the model we made use of lukemelas EfficientNet architecture. 
 

### 4.2. Hardware  <a name="42-hardware"></a> 

The GANs were trained using Google Colab. This work environment provided us an easy way to work in teams and to access to GPUs. The Classifier also started as a Google Colab project, however, due to its high computing demands, we were forced to port it to Google Cloud to avoid the time limit of the Colab.  

- **Google Cloud Platform**

To launch the instance we used Cloud Deep Learning VM Image. We created a Linux VM, with a n1-highmem-2 machine and 1 NVIDIA Tesla k80 GPU. In addition to the Instance, we created a bucket in order to upload the Images from the different datasets (the reduced one, and the ones with the GANs) to then move them to the persistent disk. We firstly implemented our code using the Jupyter Notebook function, but since the training process took a long time and Google Cloud Shell would eventually log off, we switched to SSH and launched our script from the terminal.

## 6. Conclusions <a name="6-conclusions"></a>

* **Training GANs** proved to be a **hard task**.
    * Requires a vest amount of **resources**.
    * **Training process** is **not straightforward**.

* **SNGAN outperformed** DCGAN, ACGAN and WGAN.
    * Even though **after huge amount of experimentation** metrics were still far from initial goal.

* On the **GAN training parametrization**:
    * **Batch size** is among the most relevant parameters to reduce training times and improve image quality. The reasonale behind this effect could come from the _Discriminator_ having less examples to generalize its classification of real and fake images.
    * The number of **training epochs** also affects the quality of the generated images. Longer traning usually ends up producing better images even though the two losses did not converge.
    * Another parameter tweak that comes handy when training these architectures is the **size of the latent vector**. With higher sizes the quality of images did not improve, but it did reduce the training time.
    * **Label smoothing** has another critical change that was done in our GANs. It did produce better images and also it did stabilize the training. Mathematically, the class probabilities of the discriminator are, in general, lower when using this technique and thus, it balances the performance of the _Discriminator_ and the _Generator_.
    * **Spectral normalization**, which deals with exploding gradients, did also increase the quality of the generated images. It gave out a new architecture purely based on a DCGAN.
    * **Different learning rates**, more specifically with higher values for the _Discriminator_, did stabilize training and also increased the quality of the images. The explanation behind this behavior is that setting bigger steps for optimizing the loss function of the _Discriminator_  makes this agent more imprecise at the classification task whereas the smaller steps for the _Generator_ gives it a more precise approach to image generation.

* **Different metrics** are sensible to **different aspects** of image quality.
    * Best practice to **use a set** of them to assess the generated images.
    * **Include a metric** based on **human perception**.
 
* Good results for a **lack** of **resources**.
    * Fine-tuned **EfficientNet** achieves **high accuracy** with **reduced dataset**.
    * Dataset with **sysnthetic images** does **not improve accuracy**.
    * **Balanced dataset** with **synthetic images** and no augmentations achieves **good results**.
